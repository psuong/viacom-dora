## What is Viacom-Dora?

Viacom-Dora is a HackBU project built by two members from City College for the Viacom Hackathon Challenge. The challenge was to create the best media related hack, and so we re-engineered a little "find the hiiden-objects" game using Unity, Monobehaviour, and some .NET.

The objective of the game is to find the hidden objects as fast as you can in the picture. When all the items are found, the player is brought to a reinforcements learning page.

## Reinforcements Learning Page

Essentially, the reinforcements learning page allows the user to record their own voice while stating the Spanish Equivalent of the word. As such, users can hear their own voice and compare it to the actual translation of the English word. 

## Looking Ahead

While the project will most likely remain at it's current state, a functional and flexible Microphone plugin will be developed for Unity in order to support game developers/designers create these kinds of reinforcement/interactive games.
